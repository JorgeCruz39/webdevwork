Contains work done in the web dev class

In the photo uploaded I am the gentleman on the far right :).

My experience with computers is pretty average I would say I am a student of computer science at suny newpaltz and I work at Chester union free school district as a tech. A lot of that work deals with primaraly hardware fixing and network trouble shooting. Most programs I have written have been mainly for academic purposes ( a school prjoect or a school assignment). 

What I think Ill learn in this course is creating something more interactive. Being that the apps we will be building are web based I think that there will be an aspect of being able to use it "on the go" rather than only getting functionality from a terminal environment.  Hopefully what I learn here in this class can be used later down the road in my career.
